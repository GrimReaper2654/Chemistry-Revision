# Chemistry-Revision
Just something for me to practive chemistry <br>
A tool to help with memorising the first 30 elements of the periodic table as well as some common polyatomic ions.<br>
Whether certain proterties are assessed can be toggled. Useful when you don't want to have to memorise the molar mass of everything for example.<br>
Beware of jump scares when questions are repeatedly answered incorrectly.<br>
For the atomic mass and valencies, you can answer 'IDK' to skip them if they are too difficult or irrelevant.<br>
The Failure and Stooid memes are by Steven He and the brain images were take from a random brain expanding meme.<br><br>

Warning: Getting the answer wrong repeatedly might lead to being rickrolled...
